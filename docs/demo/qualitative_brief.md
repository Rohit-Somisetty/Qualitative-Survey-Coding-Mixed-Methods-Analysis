## Exemplar quotes
> **AFFORDABILITY (household – wave 2, AL):** No slots open when my shifts change, so reliable childcare access feels impossible. Food insecurity is creeping back—we rely on the pantry between paychecks. Tuition and fees are too expensive; every increase means cutting groceries.

> **CHILDCARE_ACCESS (household – wave 1, GA):** We have been on a childcare waitlist for months after our center closed. Short staffing means inconsistent caregivers and unpredictable schedules for us. My split shift schedule never aligns with the center's hours, so coverage falls apart.

> **EMPLOYMENT_DISRUPTION (household – wave 1, IL):** Coordinating schedules with my partner and the provider is a weekly puzzle we rarely solve. I water down meals for the kids when food runs low after rent and child care. Employment keeps getting disrupted when I have to leave early for pickups.

> **FOOD_INSECURITY (household – wave 2, CA):** No slots open when my shifts change, so reliable childcare access feels impossible. We stretch groceries and sometimes skip meals so tuition can stay current.

> **PROVIDER_STAFF_SHORTAGE (provider – wave 1, AZ):** Coordinating staggered shifts with limited staff feels impossible. No substitutes are available, so I cover multiple classrooms daily. I field calls daily from parents desperate for openings we just do not have.

## Methods & limitations
- Rule-based keywords from a transparent codebook (see docs/codebook.md) drive multi-label tagging.
- Quantitative indicators are simulated with interpretable correlations; they approximate but do not replace observed data.
- Synthetic sample mirrors Jan–Mar 2024 household/provider frames; interpret directional signals, not literal magnitudes.

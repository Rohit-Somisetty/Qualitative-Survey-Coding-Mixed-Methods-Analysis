# Qualitative Coding Codebook

Transparent coding criteria ensure that mixed-methods findings are reproducible and auditable. Each theme includes a definition, indicative keywords/phrases (all lower-case for deterministic matching), and an exemplar quote to guide analysts.

| Theme | Definition | Keyword / Phrase Signals | Example Quote |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| STRESS_BURNOUT | Mentions of mental load, burnout, anxiety, or emotional exhaustion stemming from care and work responsibilities. | `stress`, `burned out`, `overwhelmed`, `mental health`, `exhausted` | "I am exhausted trying to keep up with work and caregiving, and my mental health is suffering." |
| FOOD_INSECURITY | References to skipping meals, stretching groceries, or difficulty affording food for the household or program. | `food insecurity`, `skip meals`, `pantry`, `groceries`, `food budget` | "We are stretching groceries thin and skipping meals when paychecks are late." |
| CHILDCARE_ACCESS | Concerns about finding, keeping, or affording reliable childcare slots or programs. | `waitlist`, `no slots`, `childcare access`, `center closed`, `afternoon care` | "I have been on a childcare waitlist for months since the center closed." |
| AFFORDABILITY | Mentions of high costs for childcare, housing, or essential services that strain budgets. | `too expensive`, `tuition`, `afford`, `rising costs`, `fees` | "Tuition is too expensive and every fee increase pushes us closer to debt." |
| EMPLOYMENT_DISRUPTION | Any disruption to work hours, job changes, or missed shifts tied to family or provider obligations. | `miss work`, `cut hours`, `lost job`, `shift`, `employment` | "I miss work almost weekly because schedules fall apart when care falls through." |

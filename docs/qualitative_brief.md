## Exemplar quotes
> **AFFORDABILITY (household – wave 1, TX):** We cannot afford reliable care when costs rise faster than wages. Our center says classrooms merge because of staff shortages, leaving fewer hours.

> **CHILDCARE_ACCESS (household – wave 1, CA):** Tuition and fees are too expensive; every increase means cutting groceries. Finding after-school care is a battle every semester, and options keep shrinking.

> **EMPLOYMENT_DISRUPTION (household – wave 1, CO):** I feel burned out every week trying to cover shifts and still be a present parent. Tuition and fees are too expensive; every increase means cutting groceries.

> **FOOD_INSECURITY (household – wave 1, AL):** Tuition and fees are too expensive; every increase means cutting groceries. We have been on a childcare waitlist for months after our center closed. We were told staffing shortages limit the program to part-week care.

> **PROVIDER_STAFF_SHORTAGE (provider – wave 2, FL):** We are short staffed and cannot hire assistants even after months of recruiting. Coordinating staggered shifts with limited staff feels impossible.

## Methods & limitations
- Rule-based keywords from a transparent codebook (see docs/codebook.md) drive multi-label tagging.
- Quantitative indicators are simulated with interpretable correlations; they approximate but do not replace observed data.
- Synthetic sample mirrors Jan–Mar 2024 household/provider frames; interpret directional signals, not literal magnitudes.
